    "Therefore, despite of the running py files published by Hugging Face (for example, the [run_language_modeling.py](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/master/examples/language-modeling/run_language_modeling.py) for fine-tuning the library models for language modeling on a text file (GPT, GPT-2, BERT, RoBERTa)), **when it comes necessary to fine-tune a pre-trained model to another language and/or to another task, we need to use regular Python/PyTorch modules in order to apply Transfer Learning and fine-tuning modern techniques, in particular if we do not have a huge new training dataset**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a non-exhaustive list of these fine-tuning techniques based on Transfer Learning:\n",
    "- **Learning rate finder** (method that helps finding the best learning rate to train the model)\n",
    "- **Mixed precision training** (some of the operations will be done in FP16, others in FP32 in order to speed up the training)\n",
    "- **Gradual unfreezing** (layers groups are defined allowing to decide the layers to be trained)\n",
    "- **1cycle policy** (the 1cycle policy was introduced by Leslie N. Smith et al. in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07120\">Super-Convergence: Very Fast Training of Neural Networks Using Large Learning Rates</a>. It schedules the learning rate with a cosine annealing)\n",

    "- **Distributed training** (training distributed on different GPUs in order to speed up the training)\n",

    "In order to demonstrate the feasibility of fine-tuning Hugging Face models via fastai v2, we had to choose an emblematic model of the [Transformer revolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) in the NLP since 2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, between the GPT-2 and [BERT](https://github.com/google-research/bert) models, we chose the GPT-2 model because it has strongly influenced minds beyond the circle of Deep Learning specialists in early 2019 by [writing texts of a quality level close to that of humans](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/#samples). Today \"exceeded\" in number of parameters and performance by more recent models like BART, T5 and of course GPT-3 (175 billion parameters!), it remains a reference and a model used in research and applications.\n",

    "There are 3 versions of the GPT-2 model (look at the [transformers documentation](https://huggingface.co/transformers/pretrained_models.html) for more details). Here, **we use the small version**, the one with the smallest number of weights (124 millions, not 117 as written in the original paper) but you can change the model used by changing the content of `pretrained_weights` (if it's not a GPT2 model, you'll need to change the classes used for the model and the tokenizer of course)."

It’s a causal (unidirectional) transformer pre-trained using language modeling on a very large corpus of ~40 GB of text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The abstract from the paper is the following: *GPT-2 is a large transformer-based language model with 1.5 billion parameters, trained on a dataset[1] of 8 million web pages. GPT-2 is trained with a simple objective: predict the next word, given all of the previous words within some text. The diversity of the dataset causes this simple goal to contain naturally occurring demonstrations of many tasks across diverse domains. GPT-2 is a direct scale-up of GPT, with more than 10X the parameters and trained on more than 10X the amount of data.*\n",
    "\n",
    "> Tips:\n",
    "> - GPT-2 is a model with absolute position embeddings so it’s usually advised to pad the inputs on the right rather than the left.\n",
    "> - GPT-2 was trained with a causal language modeling (CLM) objective and is therefore powerful at predicting the next token in a sequence. Leveraging this feature allows GPT-2 to generate syntactically coherent text as it can be observed in the run_generation.py example script.\n",
    "> - The PyTorch models can take the past as input, which is the previously computed key/value attention pairs. Using this past value prevents the model from re-computing pre-computed values in the context of text generation. See [reusing the past in generative models](https://huggingface.co/transformers/quickstart.html#using-the-past) for more information on the usage of this argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "> [Write With Transformer](https://transformer.huggingface.co/doc/gpt2-large) is a webapp created and hosted by Hugging Face showcasing the generative capabilities of several models. GPT-2 is one of them and is available in five different sizes: small, medium, large, xl and a distilled version of the small checkpoint: distilgpt-2.\n",

    "\n",
    "**[Abstract]** Almost all existing machine translation models are built on top of character-based vocabularies: characters, subwords orwords. Rare characters from noisy text or character-rich languages such as Japanese and Chinese however can  unnecessarily take up vocabulary slots and limit its compactness. Representing text at the level of bytes andusing  the  256 byte set as vocabulary is a potential solution to this issue. High computational cost has however prevented it from being widely deployed or used in practice. **In this paper, we investigate byte-level subwords, specifically byte-level BPE (BBPE), which is compacter than character vocabulary and has no out-of-vocabulary tokens, but is more efficient than using pure bytes only is.** We claim that contextualizing BBPE embeddings is necessary, which can be implemented by a convolutional or recurrent layer. **Our experiments show that BBPE has comparable performance to BPE while its size is only 1/8 of that for BPE.** In the multilingual setting, BBPE maximizes vocabulary sharing across many languages and achieves better translation quality. Moreover, we show that BBPE enables transferring models between languages with non-overlapping character sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**[Conclusion]** We proposed BBPE which builds a byte-level subword vocabulary for machine translation. It results in a much more compact vocabulary than character-based ones do without the loss of performance. In multilingual settings, the former often outperforms the latter. **BBPE does not have any out-of-vocabulary tokens, allowing us to transfer a model using BBPE between languages with non-overlapping vocabularies.** This transfer learning paradigm is actually very generic and can be applied to any languages and datasets for performance gain or training acceleration. With the same vocabulary size, BBPE segments sentences into shorter sequences than character-based methods do, leading to faster trainingand inference. Our future work includes: eliminating source-target sentence length imbalance; evaluating BBPE in one-to-many and many-to-many translation settings; exploring better segmentation algorithms for byte-level subwords."

      "Francisco da Silveira Pinto da Fonseca Teixeira (Canelas (Peso da Régua), 1 de Setembro de 1763 — Vila Real, 27 de Maio de 1821), 1.º conde de Amarante, mais conhecido por General Silveira, foi um oficial general do Exército Português e político, que se destacou durante a Guerra Peninsular.\n",
      "\n",
      "O general Silveira (como é mais conhecido em numerosas obras) era filho de Manuel da Silveira Pinto da Fonseca e de D. Antónia da Silveira, teve um irmão, António da Silveira Pinto da Fonseca, que foi o 1º Visconde de Canelas. Casou em 16 de Abril de 1781 com D. Maria Emília Teixeira de Magalhães e Lacerda e deste matrimónio teve três filhos: Manuel da Silveira Pinto da Fonseca Teixeira, 1º Marquês de Chaves, Miguel da Silveira Pinto da Fonseca e D. Mariana da Silveira Pinto da Fonseca.\n",
      "\n",
      "Assentou praça, como Cadete, no Regimento de Cavalaria de Almeida (mais tarde Cavalaria 11) a 25 de Abril de 1780. Ali foi promovido a Alferes em 22 de Abril de 1790 e a Tenente, no Regimento de Cavalaria 6, em 17 de Dezembro de 1792. No dia 17 de Dezembro de 1799 foi promovido a Capitão e nomeado Ajudante-de-Ordens do Governador das Armas da província da Beira. Em 1801, por decreto de 6 de Março, Francisco da Silveira foi promovido ao posto de sargento-mor. Nesse mesmo ano, quando teve início a chamada Guerra das Laranjas, juntamente com outras pessoas importantes de Trás-os-Montes, participou no levantamento de um corpo de voluntários, tendo sido nomeado a 19 de Maio Comandante-Chefe das Companhias Francas de Trás-os-Montes. Em 14 de Março de 1803 foi promovido ao posto de tenente-coronel, no Regimento de Cavalaria 6.\n",
      "\n",
      "Em Dezembro de 1807, no início da Primeira Invasão Francesa encontrava-se em Aveiro. Junot tinha dado ordem para desmobilizar a maior parte do Exército Português e formar, com as melhores unidades, um corpo de tropas que foi designado Legião Lusitana (ou Legião Portuguesa). Silveira foi chamado a Coimbra para testemunhar a desmobilização dos Regimentos de Cavalaria 6, 9, 11 e 12. Pediu a sua demissão que foi aceite pelo governo de Junot e partiu para o Porto com o objectivo de chegar a bordo da esquadra britânica que se encontrava ao largo e, dessa forma, fugir para o Brasil. Não lhe sendo possível executar este plano foi para Vila Real.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quando a insurreição que tinha nascido em Espanha chegou a Portugal, foi criada no Porto a Junta Provisional do Supremo Governo do Reino, presidida pelo bispo do Porto. A revolta rapidamente se estendeu a todo o Reino, primeiro em Trás-os-Montes, onde Francisco da Silveira teve um papel preponderante na aclamação do governo legítimo de Portugal. O papel que então desempenhou mereceu o reconhecimento da Junta do Supremo Governo do Reino que decretou, a 21 de Julho, a sua promoção a coronel do regimento de Cavalaria 6.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ainda em 1808, participou na força sob comando do general Bernardim Freire de Andrade que se dirigiu para Sul ao encontro das tropas britânicas desembarcadas em Lavos. Exercia então as funções de comandante da guarda avançada deste corpo de tropas. Depois de as tropas francesas terem saído de Portugal, Silveira regressou ao Norte para participar na reorganização do Exército. Foi promovido a Brigadeiro e nomeado Governador Militar de Trás-os-Montes por carta régia de 15 de Fevereiro de 1809. \n",
      "\n",
      "Entretanto teve início a Segunda Invasão Francesa. Perante a superioridade dos franceses, Silveira foi obrigado a abandonar a praça de Chaves, tendo-se dirigido para a região de Vila Real. Quando as tropas francesas continuaram o seu avanço em direcção a Braga, deixando uma pequena guarnição em Chaves, Silveira regressou com as suas tropas, colocou cerco aquela praça que acabou por se render pouco tempo depois. Soult ocupou o Porto em finais de Março de 1809 e Silveira, com as suas tropas mal treinadas, mal equipadas, muitos deles sem armas de fogo, desenvolveu uma actividade notável na defesa da linha do Tâmega. Desta acção, o episódio mais marcante foi a defesa da ponte de Amarante. Obrigado a retirar após catorze dias de resistência, não se deixou abater e, em breve, as suas tropas, obrigavam o corpo de tropas francesas, sob comando de Loison, a retirar para Guimarães.\n",
      "\n",
      "Na ordem do dia de 21 de Maio de 1809, o brigadeiro Francisco da Silveira era promovido a Marechal de Campo em recompensa pela forma como se bateu contra os invasores franceses. A Terceira Invasão Francesa colocou-o novamente em actividade operacional em que o seu prestígio se consolidou. Das acções em que participou destaca-se o ataque ao reduto em Puebla de Sanábria (1 a 10 de Agosto de 1810) na província de Zamora junto à fronteira no norte de Portugal, nos combates em Valverde (14 de Novembro de 1810), defesa de Pinhel (31 de Dezembro de 1810) e defesa Vila da Ponte (11 de Janeiro de 1811).\n",
      "A portaria de 5 de Fevereiro de 1812 veio confirmar a sua promoção a Tenente-general com antiguidade reportada a 1 de Janeiro desse ano. O seu valor foi reconhecido tanto pelo marechal Beresford, comandante em chefe do Exército Português, como por Wellesley que comandava o Exército Aliado na luta contra os franceses. É assim que o encontramos a comandar uma divisão de infantaria portuguesa no exército de Wellesley na Batalha de Vitoria e outras acções na fase final da guerra.\n",
      "\n",
      "Após a Guerra Peninsular, que termina em 1814, Silveira voltou ao lugar de Governador das Armas da Província de Trás-os-Montes. Em 1820, quando a 24 de Agosto rebentou a revolução Liberal, foi convidado a aderir ao partido da Junta Provisória do Porto mas recusou e reuniu em Chaves as tropas da província de Trás-os-Montes com o objectivo contrário, de combater a revolução. Não foi bem sucedido nesta empresa pois essas tropas acabaram por se colocar do lado da Junta do Porto. Depois deste episódio, Silveira retirou-se para Vila Real onde veio a falecer no ano seguinte. Foi sepultado no jazigo da família, na capela do Espírito Santo em Canelas.\n",
      "\n",
      "A 13 de Maio de 1809, o Príncipe Regente agraciou-o com o título de Conde de Amarante. A sua acção durante a Segunda Invasão Francesa mereceu-lhe o maior respeito em todo o Reino. Além desta honra, o 1º Conde de Amarante foi condecorado com a medalha de sete campanhas da Guerra Peninsular, com as medalhas britânica e espanhola por acções e batalhas nesta guerra, com os graus de grã-cruz da Ordem Militar de Cristo e de comendador honorário da Ordem Militar da Torre e Espada.\n",

The first phase takes `pct_start` of the training. You can optionally pass additional `cbs` and `reset_opt`.)\n",

    "\\n\\nNow, after almost two centuries, the mystery of what sparked this odd phenomenon is finally solved. \\\n",
    "\\n\\nDr. Jorge Pérez, an evolutionary biologist from the University of La Paz, and several companions, were exploring the Andes Mountains when they found a small valley, with no other animals or humans. Pérez noticed that the valley had what appeared to be a natural fountain, surrounded by two peaks of rock and silver snow. \\\n",
    "\\n\\nPérez and the others then ventured further into the valley. “By the time we reached the top of one peak, the water looked blue, with some crystals on top,” said Pérez. \\\n",
    "\\n\\nPérez and his friends were astonished to see the unicorn herd. These creatures could be seen from the air without having to move too much to see them – they were so close they could touch their horns. \\\n",
    "\\n\\nWhile examining these bizarre creatures the scientists discovered that the creatures also spoke some fairly regular English. Pérez stated, “We can see, for example, that they have a common ‘language,’ something like a dialect or dialectic.” \\\n",
    "\\n\\nDr. Pérez believes that the unicorns may have originated in Argentina, where the animals were believed to be descendants of a lost race of people who lived there before the arrival of humans in those parts of South America. \\\n",
    "\\n\\nWhile their origins are still unclear, some believe that perhaps the creatures were created when a human and a unicorn met each other in a time before human civilization. According to Pérez, “In South America, such incidents seem to be quite common.” \\\n",
    "\\n\\nHowever, Pérez also pointed out that it is likely that the only way of knowing for sure if unicorns are indeed the descendants of a lost alien race is through DNA. “But they seem to be able to communicate in English quite well, which I believe is a sign of evolution, or at least a change in social organization,” said the scientist.\"\n",

Ainda mais surpreendente para os pesquisadores foi o fato de que os unicórnios falavam inglês perfeito. Um deles, um escocês chamado Thomas (um anatomista irlandês) que havia trabalhado com o britânico em seu trabalho como assistente do diretor experimental da universidade, John Holley, foi chamado de por eles para um encontro sobre os dois conceitos, que não tinham encontrado muito trabalho até o momento. Eles foram palestrantes, mas ficaram impressionados que Thomas (como todos os outros cientistas da época) não sabia falar Inglês. Quando Thomas fez isso com os unicórnios por engano, Holley a escreveu e enviou um telegrama à BBC perguntando: \"\"Tão, o que é tal dizer se você quer saber de nenhum outro, eu não sei como ele fala inglês?\"\" Eles disseram a ele: \"Não, mas é um idiota.\" Então, uma semana depois, no mesmo dia, Holley o enviou, uma carta com um questionário para os membros do elenco de \"\"Doctor Who\"\".

      "Em 2015, cientistas realizaram uma nova análise sobre as formas dos unicórnios.

Em alguns casos, estes membros compartilham um mesmo conjunto (a linhagem) de partes em dois espécimes.\" O estudo indica que os membros de \"P. rubi\" são semelhantes em aparência e morfologia aos membros humanos modernos, como as fêmeas modernas e machos robustos. \"Como é evidente com os membros de \"P. rubi\", os ancestrais e o ancestral eram similares na forma e na composição das semelhanças em um organismo.\"\n",

A \"sonoroplasto\" se assemelha à \"P. rubi\" em características morfológicas e comportamentais, embora as diferenças na morfologia sejam menores. \"A espécie \"P. rubi\" apresenta cinco pares de cromossomos separados (com 6 pares se aproximando e 8 pares se afastando) e um \"sonoroplasto de base\" (com 12 pares se aproximando e 15 pares se afastando), sugerindo que o membro tenha uma composição semelhante ao ancestral \"P. rubi\n",
